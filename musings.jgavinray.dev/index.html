I received a phone call from family in another state earlier this week.  Initially I was being asked some seeming odd
questions about if it was possible for someone on an iPhone to do X or Y or Z.  I remember thinking at the time, why am
I being asked this?  And then it came out - "our bank account had been accessed and the money in the account is gone".  
While the details of it are still being looked into by the bank, it was revealed to me that somehow someone had alledged 
individual gained access to not only my family member's bank account.  


In addition to their bank account being accessed and drained, it was revealed that two other items had taken place:
Cell phone provider had transfered my families phone number to another device without getting approval from the account
owner.
Primary e-mail account was compromised.

As we continued to talk to family about what was going on, how much time was involved with getting everything squared
with the bank.  It made me realize how operational security tends to come easy for people in the tech industry because,
well frankly it becomes a way of life.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">Secure shell</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">Multi-factor authentication</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption">Disk Encryption</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength">Password Strength</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GNU Privacy Guard</a>, etc..

In talking to my wife and other family members about this, I realized that talking security isn't fun and no one wants 
to do it unless there is a problem.  And that got me thinking - what if there was a simple guide that could help you setup 
a workflow that is easy to setup, remains mostly out of your way, and can help protect your online accounts?  This is my 
stab at making such a guide*.  



*I will be upfront about this, this is <bold>NOT</bold> the end all be all guide to protecting yourself or your privacy online, 
please take a look at blogs such as <a href="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</a> or another security expert's 
website.
